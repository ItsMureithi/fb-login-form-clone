# Facebook-login-clone
This is a fun clone of the Facebook login page made using just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript!
I built this project in order to sharpen my frontend skills  as it includes  <strong> hover effects, form validation basics </strong>, and a touch of interactivity like <strong> alerting users </strong> when they click “Forgot Password.”
